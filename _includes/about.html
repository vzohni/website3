         <p>I am a creative developer and graduate at York University for Digital Media (BA). As a Software Developer and Digital Artist, it is my goal to search for innovative solutions to corporate needs and customer focused applications.</p>

        <p>Notable projects include: <br/> <br/> 

        <i>RBC Bluebird</i>, a redesigned RBC android app that won 3rd place in the <i>Make It Mobile</i> hackathon.<br/> <br/> 

        <i>Audible Shapes</i>, a 3D generative music visualizer allowing users to create music with their hands through Unity and Max/MSP.<br/> <br/> 

        <i>Guitar Plays You</i> an engaging musical project which includes a guitar employing Wii remote accelerometers to adjust a generated pitch through Max/MSP.<br/> <br/> 

        Take a look at my projects in the <b>Portfolio </b> section above! </p>

         <p>A big passion of mine is starting interesting projects, where I can meet new people and cultivate new skills. Some examples include working with departments and student organizations at York University, such as Winterâ€™s College, Creative Arts Students Association, Digital Media Students Association and CHRY Community Radio (now VIBE 1055). Outside of YorkU, I pursue projects such as performing in bands (<i>Coloured Silence, Aundein, Kyber</i>), working on movies producing scores and sound design, and developing video games (<i>Poly Ranger Games</i>). </p>
