description: The Musical Cellular Automata was the final project in an artificial life and generative coding class. The idea was to first create a cellular automaton (or automata) and generative music in real time. The result is random every time the automata is created, giving a biological element to music. Visuals are created to engage the user. Made in Max/MSP. </br></br><a href="https://github.com/vzohni/musical-cellular-automata"> Github Repo</a>
